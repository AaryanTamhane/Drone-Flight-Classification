## 🚀 Problem Statement: The Rising Threat of Rogue Drones  
Modern warfare and border security face an escalating threat: **rogue drones**. These include:  
- **Kamikaze drones** (suicide UAVs carrying explosives)  
- **Spy drones** (unauthorized surveillance)  
- **GPS-spoofed drones** (hijacked mid-flight)  

Military defenses need **real-time, AI-powered detection** to:  
✔ **Identify abnormal flight patterns** (sudden altitude drops, erratic movements)  
✔ **Distinguish friend from foe** in drone swarms  
✔ **Trigger countermeasures** (e.g., jamming, interception)
