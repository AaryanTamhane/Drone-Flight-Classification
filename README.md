# AI-Based Military Drone Anomaly Detection  
### Detecting Rogue & Kamikaze Drones Using Machine Learning  


---

## üöÄ Problem Statement: The Rising Threat of Rogue Drones  
Modern warfare and border security face an escalating threat: **rogue drones**. These include:  
- **Kamikaze drones** (suicide UAVs carrying explosives)  
- **Spy drones** (unauthorized surveillance)  
- **GPS-spoofed drones** (hijacked mid-flight)  

Military defenses need **real-time, AI-powered detection** to:  
‚úî **Identify abnormal flight patterns** (sudden altitude drops, erratic movements)  
‚úî **Distinguish friend from foe** in drone swarms  
‚úî **Trigger countermeasures** (e.g., jamming, interception)

## üí° Solution: AI-Powered Anomaly Detection  
This project simulates a **machine learning system** that:  
1. **Generates synthetic drone flight data** (normal vs. adversarial)  
2. **Trains ML models** to detect anomalies (unsupervised + deep learning)  
3. **Flags threats in real-time** (simulated environment)
