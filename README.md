Military-Focused AI Drone Anomaly Detection System
Objective:
Detect and classify hostile drone behavior (e.g., unauthorized surveillance, kamikaze drones, swarm attacks) using simulated flight data and AI threat detection models.

Key Military Use Cases:
Intrusion Detection – Identify drones entering restricted airspace.

Behavioral Anomalies – Detect erratic movement (e.g., sudden acceleration, loitering).

Swarm Attack Detection – Recognize coordinated drone threats.

GPS Spoofing/Jamming Detection – Identify manipulated navigation signals.
