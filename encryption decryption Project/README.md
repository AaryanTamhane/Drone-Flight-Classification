# Tata Drone Security - AES Encryption Demo

This project simulates secure communication for autonomous drones using **AES encryption**. It's part of a capstone project based on Tata Group's Hackathon idea.

## 🔐 Features

- Encrypt drone commands using AES (ECB mode)
- Decrypt commands securely
- Simulated sender and receiver setup
- Easy to test without real hardware

## 🧪 Files

- `encrypt_sender.py` – Encrypt and save drone command
- `decrypt_receiver.py` – Read encrypted message and decrypt
- `encrypted_command.txt` – Stores the encrypted message temporarily
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
